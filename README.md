## Instructions

1. Create a **private** repository on Github (GIT repo)
2. Create a new branch from your master branch
3. Impress us with your creativity and technical ability in building a beautiful and optmizied Angular application! Don't be afraid to import additional dependencies if you think you need them.
3. At the end of your work you should push the code into your branch
4. Create a Pull Request from your branch to the master branch
5. Add the "VGRAJED" and "jongyunchoi-sap" users as a collaborators for your private git repo
6. The final step is to send an email back to the recruiter (dominique.pirolo@sap.com) them that you finished the test including the Pull Request's URL where the code changes can be found
